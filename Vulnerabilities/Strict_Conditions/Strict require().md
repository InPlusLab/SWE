# Strict require()

The *require()* is one of the most common statements for input validation. The *require()* function determines if a specific condition is met before executing the rest of the contract code. If the condition is unmet, it throws an exception and reverts the transaction. However, if the condition is too strict, it may cause the contract's legal input to be rolled back.
