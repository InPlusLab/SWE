# Time-based Random Value Dependency
Some contracts use *block.timestamp* or *block.number* as a seed to generate random numbers. However, since timestamps and block numbers can be manipulated, these random numbers are essentially pseudo-random, and miners can indirectly manipulate the result of the random number generation. Other methods can be used to generate more reliable random numbers, such as leveraging external oracles, which can provide secure and unbiased sources of randomness. By relying on external sources of randomness, smart contracts can avoid the risks associated with timestamp-based random number generation and improve their overall security and reliability.
