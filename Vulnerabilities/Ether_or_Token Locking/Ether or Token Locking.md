# Ether / Token Locking

Ether / Token locking occurs when the contract is unavailable for withdrawal operations. In this situation, users may be unable to retrieve their deposited Ether or tokens from the contract, resulting in a significant loss of funds. This weakness is usually related to errors in the logic or execution of the contract. For example, if a contract fails to release funds after a specific period of time, or if the contract's functionality fails completely due to an error or oversight in the code, the Ether or tokens may be locked and unusable.
The impact of this weakness could be severe, as users may not be able to retrieve their funds for a long period of time, and even lose the fund permanently.
