# Denial of Service (DoS)

Denial of Service (DoS) refers to a situation where an attacker intentionally disrupts the normal features of the smart contracts. 

Smart contracts are widely utilized in certain scenarios (e.g.,  auctions, gambling, and voting) where the principle of equal participant interaction is fundamental. Nevertheless, a hacker may initiate a transaction and subsequently launch a DoS attack on the contract, impeding the ability of other users to interact with the contract. In this situation, only the attacker may acquire access to the assets stored in the contract at a lower cost (e.g., by being the sole participant in an auction).

In over investigation, we find 15 papers illustrating the DoS attack, and there are two main types of DoS weakness.
