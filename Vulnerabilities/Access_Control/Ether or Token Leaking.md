# Ether / Token Leaking

Ether or Token Leaking is a fundamental weakness in access control, whereby a smart contract lacks appropriate authorization checks before initiating a transfer of Ether or Token. This deficiency can result in unauthorized transfers, compromising the system's integrity and confidentiality. In particular, without robust access controls, a contract may permit unapproved users to initiate transfers or allow non-owners to distribute tokens through airdrops, posing serious risks to the contractual parties.
