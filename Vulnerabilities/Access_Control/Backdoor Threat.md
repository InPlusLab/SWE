# Backdoor Threat

Backdoor Threat is a special type of access control weakness. Developers can insert hidden code or functions into smart contracts to bypass normal access controls. Some DApp developers can steal assets pledged by other participants by calling hidden codes or functions. This type of attack is known as "rug pull", and such attacks can undermine users' trust in developers and lead to significant property loss.
