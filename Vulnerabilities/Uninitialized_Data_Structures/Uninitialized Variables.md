# Uninitialized Variables

In a smart contract, if a variable is not initialized, it will have an undefined initial value. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as reading or writing uncertain values through uninitialized variables, similar to uninitialized storage pointers. Additionally, an attacker may exploit uninitialized variables to execute malicious operations, which can result in security vulnerabilities such as integer overflows or underflows.
