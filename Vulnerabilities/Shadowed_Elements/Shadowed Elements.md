# Shadowed Elements

Shadowed Elements occur when variables or functions have the same name as a built-in global variable or function, leading to the built-in element being ``shadowed". This can result in unexpected behavior, as the shadowed element may be unintentionally overridden. Hackers may exploit Shadowed Built-in Elements to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions, making it a potential security risk. It is crucial for Solidity developers to be aware of these issues and adhere to best practices for naming conventions.
