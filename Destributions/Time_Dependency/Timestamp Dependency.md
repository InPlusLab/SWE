# Timestamp Dependency
The *block.timestamp* is a Unix timestamp that represents the creation time of a block, and *now* is a synonym for *block.timestamp*. Noticeably, the execution time of a transaction in Ethereum can be adjusted by manners within a flexible range as long as it falls between the latest timestamp and the time limit to create a new block.
